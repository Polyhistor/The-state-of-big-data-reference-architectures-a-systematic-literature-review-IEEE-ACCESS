 abstract = {Using Internet of Things (IoTs) and cloud computing technologies in the era of big data to design a highly shared marine logistics information platform is the basis for realizing the information, efficiency, and intelligence of its logistics process. This research integrated big data thinking and sharing concepts into shared logistics, designed the architecture of a highly shared marine logistics information platform, and proposed an implementation method and application model for the architecture. The platform design introduces artificial intelligence and IoT technologies based on GPS, general packet radio service, and automatic identification system. The platform realizes real-time positioning and monitoring of land and sea cargo, which greatly improves the efficiency of marine logistics management.},

 abstract = {In the process of management of traditional marine collective engineering management system, as the huge volume of data in marine collective engineering, it is impossible to achieve hierarchical data management. To address this problem, marine collective engineering management system with BS architecture based on big data is designed in this paper. The BS architecture of big data is used to optimize the general framework of the collective engineering management system. The system is divided into layers, the core functions and subsystems are differentiated, and the hierarchical functions of the system modules are optimized. The hardware design of the management system is realized. Logical calculation is used for qualitative analysis of engineering management data. The management order is identified through attribute identification to realize the software design of engineering management system. The experimental results show that the designed engineering management system can be applied to the marine collective engineering with big data, and the management efficiency is 34.5% higher than the traditional engineering management system.},
