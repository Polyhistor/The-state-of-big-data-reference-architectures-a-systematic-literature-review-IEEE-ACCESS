  abstract       = {Smart Healthcare systems compromise complex computations such as visualization of molecules, analysis of DNA, and therapy determination. These are considered to be complex problems that today's supercomputers are still facing. On the other hand, Quantum computing promises fast, efficient, and scalable computing resources that are sufficient to compute large and complex operations in exponential time. It is a fact that Quantum computing will adequately innovate the computation perspective. However, it is not a feasible solution yet as it is likely to be rare and highly expensive to produce. This paper presents a Quantum Cloud-as-a-service for an efficient, scalable, and secure solution for complex Smart Healthcare computations. Our novelty resides in the usage of Quantum Terminal Machines (QTM) and Blockchain technology to enhance the feasibility and security of the proposed architecture. Experimental results prove the feasibility of the architecture and the absolute security of the implemented Q-OTP encryption.},

  abstract       = {In recent times, construction industry is enduring pressure to take drastic steps to minimise waste. Waste intelligence advocates retrospective measures to manage waste after it is produced. Existing waste intelligence based waste management software are fundamentally limited and cannot facilitate stakeholders in controlling wasteful activities. Paradoxically, despite a great amount of effort, the waste being produced by the construction industry is escalating. This undesirable situation motivates a radical change from waste intelligence to waste analytics (in which waste is propose to be tackle proactively right at design through sophisticated big data technologies). This paper highlight that waste minimisation at design (a.k.a. designing-out waste) is data-driven and computationally intensive challenge. The aim of this paper is to propose a Big Data architecture for construction waste analytics. To this end, existing literature on big data technologies is reviewed to identify the critical components of the proposed Big Data based waste analytics architecture. At the crux, graph-based components are used: in particular, a graph database (Neo4J) is adopted to store highly voluminous and diverse datasets. To complement, Spark, a highly resilient graph processing system, is employed. Provision for extensions through Building Information Modelling (BIM) are also considered for synergy and greater adoption. This symbiotic integration of technologies enables a vibrant environment for design exploration and optimisation to tackle construction waste. The main contribution of this paper is that it presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first Big Data based architecture for construction waste analytics. The architecture is validated for exploratory analytics of 200,000 waste disposal records from 900 completed projects. It is revealed that existing waste management software classify the bulk of construction waste as mixed waste, which exposes poor waste data management. The findings of this paper will be of interest, more generally to researchers, who are seeking to develop big data based simulation tools in similar non-trivial applications.},

Such a number of components depend on the dimension of the involved data, so that new resources (e.g., processing or storage servers) are usually added as the working database grows. A reliable performance evaluation of these systems is at the same time crucial, in order to enable administrators and developers to keep the pace with data growth, and extremely difficult, due to the intrinsic complexity of these architectures. Notwithstanding, the available literature does not yet offer sufficient experiences, nor significant methodologies, in such a direction. This paper presents a novel modeling approach, based on mean field analysis, a set of methods for approximate inference of probabilistic models, derived from statistical physics, for performance evaluation of big data systems. This approach, by containing the excessive state space growth characterizing more traditional modeling methodologies, also requires a significantly reduced effort with respect to simulation based ones.},

It is even harder to make them while dealing with the scarcity of clear methodologies, best practices and reference architectures. In this prospect, architecture evaluation through benchmarking can be of great interest, as it enables the detection of performance anomalies or bottlenecks as you go. The problem when talking about Big Data benchmarking, is that existing solutions remain technology-related, and do not deal with the heterogeneous aspect of complex architectures. In addition to that, businesses are in general dealing with multi-layered complex systems, involving various technologies, paradigms and micro-architectures. This means that the benchmarking solution must be able to give fine-grained insights about each of the layers. A successful benchmarking system must also be seamless, easy to use, scalable, and preferably cloud native. To satisfy these requirements, we designed and implemented Babel, a generic Big Data benchmarking platform, that insures an end-to-end performance evaluation and monitoring. We present in this paper the principles, architecture, integration and deployment steps of Babel.},

The upsides of these technologies are clear: they are highly available, easily accessible, and simple to personalize; additionally they make it easy for providers to deliver individualized content cost-effectively, at scale. At the same time, a number of hurdles currently stand in the way of truly reliable, adaptive, safe and efficient personal healthcare devices. Major technological milestones will need to be reached in order to address and overcome those hurdles; and that will require closer collaboration between hardware and software developers and medical personnel such as physicians, nurses, and healthcare workers. The purpose of this special issue is to analyze the top concerns in IoT technologies that pertain to smart sensors for health care applications; particularly applications targeted at individualized tele-health interventions with the goal of enabling healthier ways of life.

This poses a paradigm shift, enabling companies to be more competitive by taking advantage of innovative technologies(cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, big data analytics and deep learning), pursuing near-zero fault, near real-time reactivity to any problem, better traceability, more predictability in manufacturing, while working to achieve cheaper product customization. The challenges arise when the dimensionality of the data generated by manufacturing processes grows, affecting the performance of algorithms, decreasing it quickly as the dimension of the search space increases. Handling large datasets with a good performance in a limited time should be the main concern in Big Data analytics. This paper focuses on a logistic process of car manufacturing, where batteries are unloaded from trucks to warehouse, and then to the point of fit, where they are assembled into the car. It presents a complete data-driven architecture, using a swarm approach for distributed data processing among all data stages, where processing nodes with different tasks and technologies can work cooperatively to complete a job.

  abstract       = {Context: Big Data systems are a class of software systems that ingest, store, process and serve massive amounts of heterogeneous data, from multiple sources. Despite their undisputed impact in current society, their engineering is still in its infancy and companies find it difficult to adopt them due to their inherent complexity. Existing attempts to provide architectural guidelines for their engineering fail to take into account important Big Data characteristics, such as the management, evolution and quality of the data. Objective: In this paper, we follow software engineering principles to refine the λ-architecture, a reference model for Big Data systems, and use it as seed to create Bolster, a software reference architecture (SRA) for semantic-aware Big Data systems. Method: By including a new layer into the λ-architecture, the Semantic Layer, Bolster is capable of handling the most representative Big Data characteristics (i.e., Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability and Veracity). Results: We present the successful implementation of Bolster in three industrial projects, involving five organizations. The validation results show high level of agreement among practitioners from all organizations with respect to standard quality factors. Conclusion: As an SRA, Bolster allows organizations to design concrete architectures tailored to their specific needs. A distinguishing feature is that it provides semantic-awareness in Big Data Systems. These are Big Data system implementations that have components to simplify data definition and exploitation. In particular, they leverage metadata (i.e., data describing data) to enable (partial) automation of data exploitation and to aid the user in their decision making processes. This simplification supports the differentiation of responsibilities into cohesive roles enhancing data governance.},

In this paper, the state-of-art of IoT energy harvesting capabilities and communication technologies in smart agriculture is presented.

The solution answers some of the biggest challenges the agriculture industry faces, especially when handling small files in a big data environment without impacting the computation performance. The solution is built on top of a pre-defined big data architecture that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data quality following a data migration strategy to ensure the data's insights. Furthermore, in this paper, we compared several machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable smart farming analytics tools in terms of forecasting and predictions.},

              Expectations regarding the future growth of Internet of Things (IoT)-related technologies are high. These expectations require the realization of a sustainable general purpose application framework that is capable to handle these kind of environments with their complexity in terms of heterogeneity and volatility. The paradigm of the Lambda architecture features key characteristics (such as, robustness, fault tolerance, scalability, generalization, extensibility, ad-hoc queries, minimal maintenance, and low-latency reads and updates) to cope with this complexity. The paper at hand suggest a basic set of strategies to handle the arising challenges regarding the volatility, heterogeneity, and desired low latency execution by reducing the overall system timing (scheduling, execution, monitoring, and faults recovery) as well as possible faults (churn, no answers to executions). The proposed strategies make use of services such as migration, replication, MapReduce simulation, and combined processing methods (batch- and streaming-based). Via these services, a distribution of tasks for the best balance of computational resources is achieved, while monitoring and management can be performed asynchronously in the background.},

The proposed scheme is the customization of the present parallel platforms to accomplish effective processing. The design offers three different modules which are the data pre-processing, data ingestion, and data processing module. The pre-processing is performed to speed up the real data processing. The recent schemes lack well-organized and effective parallel data loading and proficient communication. The Big Data storage and ingestion are achieved using optimized utility and parallel mechanisms. Optimized RDD-enabled (resilient distribution) Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN) based proposal is designed for resourceful cluster administration and computation of medical Big Data. The proposed data design is experimentally simulated with authentic datasets using Apache Spark 3.0 framework. The proposed architecture is compared with existing state-of-the-art proposals. The simulation results reveal the efficacy of the proposed system.},

  abstract       = {Nowadays, the world knows a high-speed development and evolution of technologies, vulnerable economic environments, market changes, and personalised consumer trends. The issue and challenge related to enterprises networks design are more and more critical. These networks are often designed for short terms since their strategies must be competitive and better adapted to the environment, social and economical changes. As a solution, to design a flexible and robust network, it is necessary to deal with the trade-off between conflicting qualitative and quantitative criteria such as cost, quality, delivery time, and competition, etc. To this end, using Big Data (BD) as emerging technology will enhance the real performances of these kinds of networks. Moreover, even if the literature is rich with BD models and frameworks developed for a single supply chain network (SCN), there is a real need to scale and extend these BD models to networked supply chains (NSCs). To do so, this paper proposes a BD architecture to drive a mixed-network of SCs that collaborate in serial and parallel fashions. The collaboration is set up by sharing their resources, capabilities, competencies, and information to imitate a unique organisation. The objective is to increase internal value to their shareholders (where value is seen as wealth) and deliver better external value to the end-customer (where value represents customer satisfaction). Within a mixed-network of SCs, both values are formally calculated considering both serial and parallel networks configurations. Besides, some performance factors of the proposed BD architecture such as security, flexibility, robustness and resilience are discussed.},

Some multimedia documents, although in different data formats and storage structures, often express similar semantic information. Therefore, the way to manage and retrieve multimedia documents reflecting users’ intent in heterogeneous big data environments has become an important issue. In this paper, we present an effective and economical architecture named SHMR (Semantic-based Heterogeneous Multimedia Retrieval), which uses low cost to store and retrieve semantic information from heterogeneous multimedia data. Firstly, the particularity of heterogeneous multimedia retrieval in big data environments is addressed. Secondly, an approach to extract and represent semantic information for heterogeneous multimedia documents is proposed. Thirdly, a NoSQL-based approach to semantic storage, in which multimedia can be parallel processed in distributed nodes is provided. Finally, a MapReduce-based retrieval algorithm is presented and a user feedback supported scheme to achieve high retrieval precision and good user experience is designed. The experimental results indicate that the retrieval performance and economic efficiency of SHMR are suitable for multimedia information retrieval in heterogeneous big data environments.},

  abstract       = {In this paper we propose a software architecture that allows for processing of large geospatial data sets in the cloud. Our system is modular and flexible and supports multiple algorithm design paradigms such as MapReduce, in-memory computing or agent-based programming. It contains a web-based user interface where domain experts (e.g. GIS analysts or urban planners) can define high-level processing workflows using a domain-specific language (DSL). The workflows are passed through a number of components including a parser, interpreter, and a service called job manager. These components use declarative and procedural knowledge encoded in rules to generate a processing chain specifying the execution of the workflows on a given cloud infrastructure according to the constraints defined by the user. The job manager evaluates this chain, spawns processing services in the cloud and monitors them. The services communicate with each other through a distributed file system that is scalable and fault-tolerant. Compared to previous work describing cloud infrastructures and architectures we focus on the processing of big heterogeneous geospatial data. In addition to that, we do not rely on only one specific programming model or a certain cloud infrastructure but support several ones. Combined with the possibility to control the processing through DSL-based workflows, this makes our architecture very flexible and configurable. We do not only see the cloud as a means to store and distribute large data sets but also as a way to harness the processing power of distributed computing environments for large-volume geospatial data sets. The proposed architecture design has been developed for the IQmulus research project funded by the European Commission. The paper concludes with the evaluation results from applying our solution to two example workflows from this project.},

The family feature model is derived based on a domain analysis of big data systems and represents the common and variant features. The reference architecture represents a generic structure for various application architectures of big data systems. Finally, the design rules define reusable design heuristics for designing an application architecture based on the selection of features of the family feature model and the reference architecture.

The traditional method to transcoding multi-modal multimedia big data needs expensive hardware and the amount of data increases transcoding executes a significant burden on the computing infrastructure. Therefore we illustrate a novel implementation for multimedia big data analyzing and data distribution. Our proposed architecture contains three layers such as service layer, platform layer and infrastructure layer. We design and implement the platform layer of the system by using a MapReduce framework running on a hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and the media processing libraries Xuggler. In this way, our proposed system reduces the time for transcoding large amounts of data into specific formats depending on the user requirements. It provides flexible multimedia record/write interface and we can build large scale multimedia big data analytic applications based on Hadoop cloud platform. Moreover, we proposed the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for efficient resource allocation in infrastructure layer. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can optimally allocate VM to achieve a minimal response time.},

This raises many opportunities to develop new innovative telematics services, including, among others, driver safety, customer experience, location-based services and infotainment. Indeed, it is expected that there will be roughly 2 billion connected cars by the end of 2025 on the world’s roadways, where each of which can produce up to 30 terabytes of data per day. Managing this big automotive data, in real and batch modes, imposes tight constraints on the underlying data management platform. To contribute to this research area, in this paper, we report on a real, in-production automotive big data platform; specifically, the one deployed by Groupe PSA (a French car manufacturer known also as Peugeot-Citroën). In particular, we present the technologies and open-source products used within the different components of this CV platform to gather, store, process, and leverage big automotive data. The proposed architecture is then assessed through realistic experiments, and the obtained results are reported and analyzed.

  abstract       = {Big Data management has become a critical task in many application systems, which usually rely on heavyweight batch processes to manage such large amounts of data. However, batch architectures are not an adequate choice for designing real-time systems in which data updates and reads must be satisfied with very low latency. Thus, gathering and consuming high volumes of data at high velocities is an emerging challenge which we specifically address in the scope of innovative scenarios based on semantic data (RDF) management. The Linked Open Data initiative or emergent projects in the Internet of Things are examples of such scenarios. This paper describes a new architecture (referred to as Solid) which separates the complexities of Big Semantic Data storage and indexing from real-time data acquisition and consumption. This decision relies on the use of two optimized datastores which respectively store historical (big) data and run-time data. It ensures efficient volume management and high processing velocity, but adds the need of coordinating both datastores. Solid  proposes a 3-tiered architecture in which each responsibility is specifically addressed. Besides its theoretical description, we also propose and evaluate a Solid  prototype built on top of binary RDF and state-of-the-art triplestores. Our experimental numbers report that Solid  achieves large savings in data storage (it uses up to 5 times less space than the compared triplestores), while provides efficient SPARQL resolution over the Big Semantic Data (in the order of 10–20 ms for the studied queries). These experiments also show that Solid  ensures low-latency operations because data effectively managed in real-time remain small, so do not suffer Big Data issues.},

Likewise, we provide a tool compliant to the metamodel that automates the generation of configuration, deployment and launch files and their corresponding transference and execution in the nodes of the platform.

  abstract       = {In the past few years, Big Data analytics have changed the way computing services and resources are being used. New users are getting into the cloud services provided by data centers on a daily basis, and the number of applications hosted on the clouds is rapidly increasing. However, existing data center architectures cannot cope with the black-box nature of the cloud nor with Big Data analytics. Current data center networks using electrical packet switches have many disadvantages. Electrical links consume too much power to handle the increased bandwidth demanded by emerging applications. They are often not suitable for providing high bandwidth at low latency and have bottleneck issues. A promising solution involves adding optical interconnections to the infrastructure in data centers offering high throughput, low latency, and incredibly low energy consumption compared to the current data center networks based on commodity switches. In this work, we propose a hybrid electrical and optical networking architecture for data centers hosting Cloud Computing and Big Data applications. Furthermore, we analyze and compare application behaviors with current and proposed hybrid architectures. The results show that hybrid architecture provides a viable solution to data center issues and easily outperforms existing data center architectures. The results reflect that hybrid architecture reduces the delay by nearly 39% and decreases the cost of cooling systems from 49.57% to 27% of the total costs, while reducing the overall long-term costs of data centers.},

Next generation datacenters need to offer enhanced support for: (i) fast changing system configuration requirements due to workload constraints, (ii) timely adoption of emerging hardware technologies, and (iii) maximal sharing of systems and subsystems in order to lower costs. Disaggregated datacenters, constructed as a collection of individual resources such as CPU, memory, disks etc., and composed into workload execution units on demand, are an interesting new trend that can address the above challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of composable systems through building a rack scale composable system prototype using PCIe switches. Through empirical approaches, we develop an assessment of the opportunities and challenges for leveraging the composable architecture for rack scale cloud datacenters with a focus on big data and NoSQL workloads. In particular, we compare and contrast the programming models that can be used to access the composable resources, and develop the implications for the network and resource provisioning and management for rack scale architecture.},

The majority of research documents related to the telecommunications industry have not addressed BDA project implementation from start to finish. The purpose of this study focuses on a BDA telecommunications project, namely, Project’s Governance, Architecture, Data Governance and the BDA Project’s Team. The last part of this study presents useful BDA use cases, in terms of applications enabling revenue creation and cost optimization. It appears that this work will facilitate the implementation of BDA projects, and enable telecommunications operators to have a better understanding about the fundamental aspects to be focused on.

  abstract       = {Context
              The rapid prevalence and potential impact of big data analytics platforms have sparked an interest amongst different practitioners and academia. Manufacturing organisations are particularly well suited to benefit from data analytics platforms in their entire product lifecycle management for intelligent information processing, performing manufacturing activities, and creating value chains. This needs a systematic re-architecting approach incorportaitng careful and thorough evaluation of goals for integrating manufacturing legacy information systems with data analytics platforms. Furthermore, ameliorating the uncertainty of the impact the new big data architecture on system quality goals is needed to avoid cost blowout in implementation and testing phases.
              Objective
              We propose an approach for goal-obstacle analysis and selecting suitable big data solution architectures that satisfy quality goal preferences and constraints of stakeholders at the presence of the decision outcome uncertainty. The approach will highlight situations that may impede the goals. They will be assessed and resolved to generate complete requirements of an architectural solution.
              Method
              The approach employs goal-oriented modelling to identify obstacles causing quality goal failure and their corresponding resolution tactics. Next, it combines fuzzy logic to explore uncertainties in solution architectures and to find an optimal set of architectural decisions for the big data enablement process of manufacturing systems.
              Result
              The approach brings two innovations to the state of the art of big data analytics platform adoption in manufacturing systems: (i) A goal-oriented modelling for exploring goals and obstacles in integrating systems with data analytics platforms at the requirement level and (ii) An analysis of the architectural decisions under uncertainty. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated with a scenario of reengineering a hyper-connected manufacturing collaboration system to a new big data architecture.},

Masci where he obtains a 2-2.5x performance. Surprisingly, the Westmere with the Tesla GPU scales comparably with the Sandy Bridge and the Phi Co-Processor up to 12 processes and then fails to continue to scale. The performances across 20 CPU nodes of SandyBridge obtains a uniform speedup of 0.5X over Westmere for problem sizes of 10K, 20K and 40K unknowns.

Though several intrusion detection methods have been introduced in the past years, developing an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with prevailing intrusion detection strategy is still very much desirable. Hence, a robust and effective intrusion detection approach, named RV coefficient+Exponential Sea Lion Optimization-enabled Deep Residual Network (ExpSLO-enabled DRN) using spark is devised for the intrusion detection. Here, the unique features are selected using proposed RV coefficient-based hybrid feature fusion, which is designed by the incorporation of wrapper, class-wise information gain (CIG), and Canberra distance in slave node. With the distinctive features selected, the process of data augmentation is done using oversampling for making the data more appropriate to perform the further process in the slave node. Moreover, DRN classifier is utilized for detecting the intrusions in the master node where the DRN training is done using devised ExpSLO algorithm, which is the hybridization of Exponentially Weighted Moving average (EWMA) and Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). Furthermore, the devised method obtained better performance by considering the evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F-measure with the higher values of 0.8800, 0.8845, and 0.8822 based on without attacks using dataset-2.},

Since then, companies have reported how software architecting helped them to tackle various challenges in system design, especially related to system-level quality properties such as scalability and maintainability. Academic research in software architecture has focused on several areas, including architecture description through views and architecture description languages, and on methods for evaluating architectural designs. While much of the contribution of research in software architecture was inspired by industrial experiences, little of the research was validated beyond individual case studies. Many scientific disciplines are currently harvesting fruits from large-scale data collection about their subjects of study. Therefore, this chapter contributes a discussion of challenges and directions for Big Data-driven studies of software architecture. Given the large amount of effort that is needed for this type of research, a promising direction is to look into a community-based infrastructure for enabling and supporting this type of research. We share lessons learned through building various tools that could form building blocks in such an infrastructure. Based on these, we synthesize a reference architecture for creating such a community-wide infrastructure for Big Data-based research in software architecture.},

A big data driven layered architecture and the hierarchical CPS-Digital-Twin(CPSDT) reconfiguration control mechanism of BDHDTPREMfg are respectively developed. Then, this paper presents an application scenario of BDHDTPREMfg to validate the feasibility and effectiveness. Based on the above application analysis, the benefits of penetrating BDHDTPREMfg into the entire lifecycle are demonstrated. The summary of this paper and future research work is discussed in the end.},

Technological innovation offers a range of renewable generation and energy management options which require fine tuning and accurate control to be successful, which calls for the use of large-scale, detailed datasets. In this paper, we focus on the UK and use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate electricity generation options against technical, environmental and social criteria. Data incompleteness and redundancy, usual in large-scale datasets, as well as expert opinion ambiguity are dealt with using a comprehensive grey TOPSIS model. We used evaluation scores to develop a multi-objective optimization model to maximize the technical, environmental and social utility of the electricity generation mix and to enable a larger role for innovative technologies. Demand uncertainty was handled with an interval range and we developed our problem with multi-objective grey linear programming (MOGLP). Solving the mathematical model provided us with the electricity generation mix for every 5 min of the period under study. Our results indicate that nuclear and renewable energy options, specifically wind, solar, and hydro, but not biomass energy, perform better against all criteria indicating that interindustry architectural innovation in the power generation mix is key to sustainable UK electricity production and supply.},

  abstract       = {Background and objectives
              Mobile and ubiquitous devices are everywhere, generating an exorbitant amount of data. New generations of healthcare systems are using mobile devices to continuously collect large amounts of different types of data from patients with chronic diseases. The challenge with such Mobile Big Data in general, is how to meet the growing performance demands of the mobile resources handling these tasks, while simultaneously minimizing their consumption.
              Methods
              This research proposes a scalable architecture for processing Mobile Big Data. The architecture is developed around three new algorithms for the effective use of resources in performing mobile data processing and analytics: mobile resources optimization, mobile analytics customization, and mobile offloading. The mobile resources optimization algorithm monitors resources and automatically switches off unused network connections and application services whenever resources are limited. The mobile analytics customization algorithm attempts to save energy by customizing the analytics processes through the implementation of some data-aware schemes. Finally, the mobile offloading algorithm uses some heuristics to intelligently decide whether to process data locally, or delegate it to a cloud back-end server.
              Results
              The three algorithms mentioned above are tested using Android-based mobile devices on real Electroencephalography (EEG) data streams retrieved from sensors and an online data bank. Results show that the three combined algorithms proved their effectiveness in optimizing the resources of mobile devices in handling, processing, and analyzing EEG data.
              Conclusion
              We developed an energy-efficient model for Mobile Big Data which addressed key limitations in mobile device processing and analytics and reduced execution time and limited battery resources. This was supported with the development of three new algorithms for the effective use of resources, energy saving, parallel processing and analytics customization.},

  abstract       = {Physiological monitors produce data essential to patient care. While the data is routinely observed and used at the bedside, it is rarely recorded permanently. Majority of data, especially high-resolution EKG waveforms, is discarded immediately. As the roles of big data and analytics in medicine are evolving, the streaming output of physiological monitors offers a potential source of highly relevant data for decision making and research. The inherently high volume and velocity of physiological data pose unique practical challenges for collection, storage, and analysis. A successful solution has to enable consistent and constant connectivity for streaming and to provide adequate storage and access capabilities. The solution also needs to meet security and privacy requirements for medical data. We propose a scalable, distributed architecture that leverages open-source stream processing software to connect raw monitoring output to a file storage system and an integration with existing data warehouse and data retrieval systems. Analytics pipeline has a potential to provide real-time feedback to the clinicians, including critical event detection or even prediction. The combination of real-time analysis and distributed storage of physiological big data, previously discarded, now opens up possibilities for future applications relevant to both clinicians and researchers alike. We have built and tested the first version of the continuously streaming data pipeline, from bedside physiological monitors to the storage. The results are promising, with raw or analyzed and enriched data already finding their place in supporting a variety of research use cases.},

The variety of big data architectures (and of their possible realization) for both batch and streaming processing in a huge number of application domains, makes the benchmarking of these systems critical for both academic and industrial communities. In this work, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-art big data architectures, namely Lambda and Kappa, considering OSN data analysis as reference task. In more details, we have implemented and deployed an influence analysis algorithm on the Microsoft Azure public cloud platform to investigate the impact of a number of factors on the performance obtained by cloud users. These factors comprise the type of the implemented architecture, the volume of the data to analyze, the size of the cluster of nodes realizing the architectures and their characteristics, the deployment costs, as well as the quality of the output when the analysis is subjected to strict temporal deadlines. Experimental campaigns have been carried out on the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million (YFCC100M). Reported results and discussions show that Lambda outperforms Kappa architecture for the class of problems investigated. Providing a variety of analyses – e.g., also investigating the impact of dataset size, scaling, cost – this paper provides useful insights on the performance of these state-of-art big data architectures that are helpful to both experts and newcomers interested in deploying big data architectures leveraging cloud platforms.},

However, implementation of the CP strategy was facing barriers, such as the lack of complete data and valuable knowledge that can be employed to provide better support on decision-making of coordination and optimization on the product lifecycle management (PLM) and the whole CP process. Fortunately, with the wide use of smart sensing devices in PLM, a large amount of real-time and multi-source lifecycle big data can now be collected. To make better PLM and CP decisions based on these data, in this paper, an overall architecture of big data-based analytics for product lifecycle (BDA-PL) was proposed. It integrated big data analytics and service-driven patterns that helped to overcome the above-mentioned barriers. Under the architecture, the availability and accessibility of data and knowledge related to the product were achieved. Focusing on manufacturing and maintenance process of the product lifecycle, and the key technologies were developed to implement the big data analytics. The presented architecture was demonstrated by an application scenario, and some observations and findings were discussed in details. The results showed that the proposed architecture benefited customers, manufacturers, environment and even all stages of PLM, and effectively promoted the implementation of CP. In addition, the managerial implications of the proposed architecture for four departments were analyzed and discussed. The new CP strategy provided a theoretical and practical basis for the sustainable development of manufacturing enterprises.},

IoT devices produce a massive amount of precious agri-data, which are collected and analyzed in real-time using innovative application tools. This combination of technology, known as “Smart farming”, helps various stakeholders in the agri-ecosystem to monitor crops in real-time, as well as maximize productivity and profitability in farm and business operations with the minimum efforts. Although many Smart farming solutions have been introduced, both from industry and academia, universal applicability of these approaches for other farms, unfortunately, is not feasible. Most of these solutions are based on a home-made non-standard Big data processing architecture. In this paper, we propose WALLeSMART, a cloud-based Smart farming management system, applied to the Wallonia region of Belgium.

  abstract       = {The ever-growing data volume in big data era drives designers to find more efficient processor architectures both in performance and energy consumption. Among various computing patterns in big data applications, string operations are common but important parts of data processing. However, due to the consideration of generality, current general-purpose CPUs are not efficient in both performance and energy consumption when processing simple and fixed computation patterns of discrete string operations. On the other hand, moving massive data from memory to computing units through NoC, Cache hierarchies, and other memory access data paths is time-consuming and especially energy consuming. Fortunately, emerging technologies, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), enable the processing-in-memory (PIM) functionality without transferring massive data to remote processing units. In this paper, we propose PIM-WEAVER, a high-efficiency novel acceleration architecture for string processing using PIM mechanism, which is the 3D integration technology that facilitates stacking logic and memory dies in a single package. The PIM-WEAVER is implemented using such technology by integrating string processing units into the real world HMC memory. In PIM-WEAVER, the general-purpose acceleration architecture for string operation is implemented within the memory cube, which can reduce the latency of data transfer and also save energy. We also propose a full-stack solution of programming interface and control mechanism of instruction level. Our comprehensive evaluations using typical string processing algorithms from big data applications show that the PIM-WEAVER gains an average speedup of 14.74x over high-performance Intel processor, and reduces the energy consumption by 82.1% on average, with tiny area overhead.},

  abstract       = {The rapid and extensive pervasion of big data has enhanced the revolution of the society. A great interest has arisen in the past five years for mining and sharing the massive data. However, implementation of the big data analysis is facing many challenges, such as the storage, transmission, and computing. How to make the decision more intelligent in latency time becomes a crucial requirement for many researches. In this paper, a double-layered architecture ATWDP of online and offline analytics for solar cells series welding machine industry is proposed and the distributed and parallel computing system can handle the above challenges. The ATWDP offers an approach to analyze the data gathered from various sensing devices stably and efficiently. Some key implementation technologies in the system are discussed, especially the Hadoop Apache framework. The evaluation of service quality based on Support Vector Machine-Dempster Shafer Theory (SVMs-DS) and Spark is an application scenario to illustrate the mechanism of the ATWDP. And a data set is used to verify the rationality of the ATWDP in the storage and processing. Test results show that the ATWDP platform has a good performance and is a suitable solution for dealing with the big data of solar cells series welding machine.},

  abstract       = {Wearable medical devices with sensor continuously generate enormous data which is often called as big data mixed with structured and unstructured data. Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.},

In a nonisolated cloud system, the different tenants can freely use the resources of the server. Hereby, disruptive tenants who exceed their limits can easily cause degradation of performance of the provided services for other tenants. To ensure performance demands of the multiple tenants and meet fairness criteria, various performance isolation approaches have been introduced including artificial delay, round robin, blacklist, and thread pool. Each of these performance isolation approaches adopts different strategies to avoid the performance interference in case of multiple concurrent tenant needs. In this paper, we propose a framework and a systematic approach for performance isolation in cloud-based big data systems. To this end, we present an architecture design of cloud-based big data system and discuss the integration of feasible performance isolation approaches. We evaluate our approach using PublicFeed, a social media application that is based on a cloud-based big data platform.},

However, an organization only derives value from data and analytics when (1) the collection of big data is organized, systematic and automated and (2) the use of data and analytic insight is embedded in the organization's day-to-day operation. Often the ambition of a big data and analytics solution requires data to flow freely across an organization. This can be in direct conflict with the organization's political and process silos that exist to partition the work of the organization into manageable chunks of function and responsibility. Thus the architecture of a big data solution must accommodate the realities within the organization to ensure sufficient value is realized by all of the stakeholders that are needed to enable this data interchange. Through examples of architectures for big data and analytics solutions, we explain how the scope of a big data solution can affect its architecture and the additional components necessary when a big data solution needs to span multiple organization silos.},

In this paper, a three layered big data analytic architecture is designed to analyze the data generated during the construction of the barrier and detection of the intruder using camera sensors. Besides, a cloud layer is designed for storing the analyzed data to study the behavior of the intruder. In order to minimize the number of camera sensors for constructing the barrier, algorithms are designed to construct the single barrier with limited node mobility and the barrier path Quality of Sensing (QoS) is maintained with a minimum number of camera sensors. Simulation results show that our algorithms can construct 100% of the barrier with fewer number of camera sensors and average data processing time can be reduced by using parallel servers even if for larger size of data.},

Different issues have ascended in the area of Big data security such as infrastructure security, data privacy, data management and data integrity. Currently, Big data processing, analytics and storage is secured using cryptography algorithms, which are not appropriate for Big data protection over Cloud. In this paper, we present a solution for addressing the main issues in Big data security over Cloud. We propose a novel system architecture called the Secure Authentication and Data Sharing in Cloud (SADS-Cloud). There are three processes involved in this paper including (i). Big Data Outsourcing, (ii). Big Data Sharing and (iii). Big Data Management. In Big data outsourcing, the data owners are registered to a Trust Center using SHA-3 hashing algorithm. The MapReduce model is used to split the input file into fixed-size of blocks of data and SALSA20 encryption algorithm is applied over each block. In Big data sharing, data users participate in a secure file retrieval. For this purpose, user's credentials (ID, password, secure ID, and current timestamp, email id) are hashed and compared with that stored in a database. In Big data management, there are three important processes implemented to organize data. They are as follows: Compression using Lemperl Ziv Markow Algorithm (LZMA), Clustering using Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Indexing using Fractal Index Tree. The proposed scheme for these processes are implemented using Java Programming and performance tested for the following metrics: Information Loss, Compression Ratio, Throughput, Encryption Time and Decryption Time.},

  abstract       = {Multimedia big data is difficult to handle because of its enormous amount and the elusive property of underlying information. To study how to explore valuable information among multimedia big data with low complexity, this paper proposes an object detection method of big data, which is in compressive measurement domain under a mobile distributed computing architecture. It includes the sparse representation and object detection processes. Considering the unbalanced computation capacity between a mobile center cloud and mobile edge sites, we shift large storage burden into the cloud, while performing the dictionary learning by using compressive measurements in the mobile edge sites. Specifically, after getting the measurements at the edge sites, we perform dictionary learning to obtain the sparse representation in pixel domain, then select significant images and their feature vectors to be stored in the center cloud. In addition, we also analyze the trained dictionary in the measurement domain employing measurements. In order to reveal the two kinds of dictionaries’ relationship, we conduct a formulation process into each of them and find that the relationship depends on the uniqueness relation between the original signal and the sparse coefficient in the measurement domain. At the same time, we keep coefficients for a certain time period at the mobile edge sites in order to realize real time object detection, taking the advantage of low latency of the mobile edge computing ends. Since the sparse coefficients and the original signal have a one-to-one correspondence relationship, we can just search for the matched coefficients of the image block for detecting object. Experimental results show that Hadamard measurement matrix can better preserve the characteristics of the original signal than Gaussian matrix and that the proposed method can achieve a favorable detection performance. Meanwhile, the computation cost and storage cost of the proposed detection process can be significantly reduced compared with traditional methods, which is suitable for the multimedia big data. This can also be used in smart cities for looking for lost children and other specific events.},

              We aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for BDCA systems.
              Method
              We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for reviewing 74 papers.
              Result
              Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes for BDCA systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the identified quality attributes. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each.
              Conclusion
              Our study reveals that in the context of BDCA (a) performance, accuracy and scalability are the most important quality concerns (b) data analytics is the most critical architectural component (c) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support (d) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of the codified tactics and explore the quality trade-offs and dependencies among the tactics and (e) the reported tactics need to be modelled using a standardized modelling language such as UML.},

Within the big data framework, the proposed model can be used as a decision support tool by the companies to evaluate their KPIs in a real-time dynamic system.},

  abstract       = {In the process of management of traditional marine collective engineering management system, as the huge volume of data in marine collective engineering, it is impossible to achieve hierarchical data management. To address this problem, marine collective engineering management system with BS architecture based on big data is designed in this paper. The BS architecture of big data is used to optimize the general framework of the collective engineering management system. The system is divided into layers, the core functions and subsystems are differentiated, and the hierarchical functions of the system modules are optimized. The hardware design of the management system is realized. Logical calculation is used for qualitative analysis of engineering management data. The management order is identified through attribute identification to realize the software design of engineering management system. The experimental results show that the designed engineering management system can be applied to the marine collective engineering with big data, and the management efficiency is 34.5% higher than the traditional engineering management system.},

  abstract       = {Big Data is the term used to describe the deluge of data in our networked, digitized, sensor-laden, information driven world. There is a broad agreement among commercial, academic, and government leaders about the remarkable potential of "Big Data" to spark innovation, fuel commerce, and drive progress. The availability of vast data resources carries the potential to answer questions previously out of reach. However, there is also broad agreement on the ability of Big Data to overwhelm traditional approaches. Big Data architectures come in many shapes and forms ranging from academic research settings to product-oriented workflows. With massive-scale dynamic data being generate from social media, Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and others, it is critical to analyze these data in real-time and provide proactive decision. With the advancement of computer architecture in multi-cores and GPUs, and fast communication between CPUs and GPUs, parallel processing utilizes these platforms could optimize resources at a reduced time. This presentation will provide the past, current, and future activities of the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) and how the NIST Reference Architecture may address the rate at which data volumes, speeds, and complexity are growing requires new forms of computing infrastructure to enable Big Data analytics interoperability such that analytics tools can be re-usable, deployable, and operational. The focus of NBD-PWG is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and standards roadmap which would create vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic framework. The aim is to enable Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing under the most suitable computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-additions from Big Data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.},

GATE project aims to establish and sustain in the long run a Centre of Excellence as collaborative environment for conducting Big Data research and innovation, facilitated by GATE platform and Innovation Labs. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of GATE platform, that is holistic, symbiotic, open, evolving and data-integrated. It is also modular and with component-based design that allows to position a mix of products and tools from different providers. GATE platform will enable start-ups, SMEs and large enterprises, as well as other organizations in a wide range of sectors, to build advanced Data driven services and applications. The usability of the proposed architecture is proven through a development of a sample time series data visualization application. Its architecture follows the proposed one through implementation of required components using open technology stack.},

However, the main characteristics, basic requirements, and modules and organization of big data architectures are not still widely known. Besides that, no detailed overview about them is available. The main contribution of this paper is to present the state of the art related to big data software architectures; for this, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study. As results, an essential set of eight requirements for big data architectures was identified, besides a collection of five modules that are fundamental to adequately enable the data flow. We also intend these results can guide architects in the development of software systems for this new challenging scenario of big data management.},

  abstract       = {Emerging big data analytics applications require a significant amount of server computational power. The costs of building and running a computing server to process big data and the capacity to which we can scale it are driven in large part by those computational resources. However, big data applications share many characteristics that are fundamentally different from traditional desktop, parallel, and scale-out applications. Big data analytics applications rely heavily on specific deep machine learning and data mining algorithms, and are running a complex and deep software stack with various components (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, MPI, Hbase, Impala, MySQL, Hive, Shark, Apache, and MangoDB) that are bound together with a runtime software system and interact significantly with I/O and OS, exhibiting high computational intensity, memory intensity, I/O intensity and control intensity. Current server designs, based on commodity homogeneous processors, will not be the most efficient in terms of performance/watt for this emerging class of applications. In other domains, heterogeneous architectures have emerged as a promising solution to enhance energy-efficiency by allowing each application to run on a core that matches resource needs more closely than a one-size-fits-all core. A heterogeneous architecture integrates cores with various micro-architectures and accelerators to provide more opportunity for efficient workload mapping. In this work, through methodical investigation of power and performance measurements, and comprehensive system level characterization, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous architecture combining high performance big and low power little cores is required for efficient big data analytics applications processing, and in particular in the presence of accelerators and near real-time performance constraints.},

It can also require the application of performance-oriented spatial data processing of such data. In this paper, we present a platform (SMASH) that tackles many of the specific challenges raised by the transport domain. We present a range of case studies applying SMASH to transport and other data used to understand traffic phenomenon across the State of Victoria, Australia. The novelty of this work is that this Cloud-based platform is not designed for a specific type of data or for a specific form of data processing. Rather it supports a range of data flavours with a range of data processing possibilities. In particular we show how the platform can be used for analyzing social media data used for traffic jam identification through spatial and temporal clustering tweets on the road network and compare the results with official real-time traffic data based on the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS - www.scats.com.au) that has been rolled out across Victoria.},

One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data. It provides different functions and capabilities to use big data and provide smart capabilities as services that the architecture supports. As a result, different big data applications will be able to access and use these services for varying proposes within the smart city.},

  abstract       = {Today Big Data tools are not just a phenomenon of the massive information collection; they are also the best way to approach a customer target. These technologies allow the profiling of the customers of an organization thanks to the histories of purchases, the products that they consult; the data that they share through the social networks. They also make it possible to anticipate the purchase of actions via behavioral analysis. Therefore, the combination of the power of CRM and the performance of BIG DATA tools brings a great added value for customers profile analysis, especially if it is about events triggered in real time. It is in this context that the present work is positioned. Our goal is to intercept events (customer behaviors) and analyze them in real time. We will use the Complex Events Process (CEP) architecture that perfectly meets this need. In order to successfully implement our CEP architecture, we will use the ontology approach.},

  abstract       = {Information is one of the most important factors in business success, hence the importance of the Business Intelligence (BI) domain in order to simplify the decision making and make it more relevant. Decisional systems have been used for several years to help decision-makers access, analyze and extract value from the data that their organisation accumulated through the years. The success gained by these types of systems caused the establishment of a well-known architecture and development chain, and the proliferation of tools and methodologies that have proven their value. Nonetheless, in some use cases, the classical decisional architecture shows some shortcomings. In fact, the traditional storage and processing models in Business Intelligence systems are not sufficient anymore when confronted with data that becomes more and more massive, varied and with a high velocity. This is where Big Data solutions can be of great use. In fact, these solutions have proven their efficiency when dealing with enormous constantly increasing amounts of data with a changing schema. Our goal in this article is to show the various manners to integrate big data solutions into the decisional world, and to help architects choose which architecture corresponds better to their needs, by taking into consideration the environmental, technical and functional constraints they are faced with.},

Enterprise Architecture (EA) can be used as an instrument to integrate big data (BD) in the existing business processes and ICT-landscape. In this policy paper, we explore the role of EA in the adoption of BD. For this, we adopted a qualitative case study approach and investigated a large administrative organization that was in the process of adopting BD. We found in our case study that the first attempts were focused on integrating big data in the current landscape, but this encountered too many challenges that halt progress. To overcome the challenges, a separate BD department and accompanying infrastructure was created. The strategy was first to reap the benefits of BD and to understand what should be done, and thereafter integrating the working systems in the existing landscape. The findings suggest that current infrastructures might not be suitable for integrating BD and substantial changes are needed first. In the case the role of BD needed to be first clarified before EA could play a role in adopting BD. EA should deal with the uncertainties and complexities by ensuring a configurable landscape, by providing an incremental approach for adapting the infrastructure step-by-step, before the benefits of big data can be gained. Developing an incremental migration plan was found to be a key aspect for the adoption of BD.},

  abstract       = {Recently, educational institutions suffer from high electrical consumption due to their new practices and activities. One of the promising solutions to overcome this challenge is to improve their energy management strategies using smart grids which ensure efficiency, reliability and energy saving. For this same reason, the National School of Applied Sciences of El Jadida -- Morocco has decided to install a private smart grid based on photovoltaic panels that will cover 40% of its electricity needs. But the problem that arises when using this new approach is the high level of complexity in term of data management due to the variety, veracity and the volume of the data. So, to meet these needs the use of Big Data technologies is required. In this paper, we propose a Big Data solution based on Lambda architecture to handle electrical consumption data in the National School of Applied Sciences of El Jadida -- Morocco. This system collects all parameters that might influence electrical consumption with Kafka, then it applies Spark libraries to analyze it. The solution allows also electrical energy forecasting using Spark machine learning library and the data persistence using HBase storage system.},

As a case study, we investigated the relation between the public opinions on social media about cryptocurrencies and the changes in their prices using lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches with the goal of assessing the feasibility of predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies. Two different approaches with two lexicons were used for sentiment analysis score calculations to assess the consistency of correlation measures on the collected dataset. Our model indicates that the prediction of cryptocurrency price changes using lexicon-based sentiment analysis methods is not reliable.},
